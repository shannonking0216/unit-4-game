The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. 
This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 

PSEUDOCODE:
Target score
User's score
Each crystal has a different value assigned to it; These values change each time
The player tries to get to the target score by clicking on the crystals
Target score is different each time 
Crystal scores also reset each time 


Here's how the app works:

1. There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.

2. The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. The random number shown at the start of the game should be 
        between 19 - 120.

3. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

4. Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal. When they do click a crystal, update the player's score counter.

5. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score           goes above the random number.

6. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

7. When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of       course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

8. The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the        game.
